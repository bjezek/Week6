# Analysis of San-Fran housing opportunity

I would invest in Financal District North, Corona Heights, Croker Amazon & Cow hollow, they are staring to trend upwards and the
expansion trend looks to be just starting heading into 2016. I believe it would be wise to say away from 
 Buena Vista Park due to the expansion line trending for several years and is one of the lowest sqft and rent combos in San Fransisco. Now and I feel like we might have
 missed it when it was really cheap! but still not bad just not as good as the other onces I listed above. The
 neighborhoods I listed as good investment and rental opportunites are sure to be portfoitable, I believe the 
Have a strong sqt to gross rent relationship over the other neighborhoods listed.
